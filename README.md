# Surfs_Up_Challenge

## Background
W. Avy likes your analysis but he wants more inoformation about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-around. 

## Methodology
* Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
* Deliberable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December
* Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis (README.md)

## Overview of Statistical Analysis
The purpose of the analysis is to determine whether or not the average temperature in Oahu, Hi is sustatainable enough throughout the year to validate W. Avy's business idea to open a Surf and Ice Cream shop on the island. 

## Results
From our analysis we can draw the following conclusions...

* The Average (mean) temperture for the island varies only by 3 degrees
* The Minimum temperture between June and December has a variability of 8 degrees
* The Maximum temperture between June and December has a variabliity of only 2 degrees

## Summary
Based upon our statistical analysis of the weather patterns of Oahu, Hi for the months of June and December we can conclude there is little variance between the two months temperatures, therefore it would give us a strong indication that W. Avy's plan to open a surf and ice cream shop would be a viable idea.
